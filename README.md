# PythonAudioProcessing
Welcome to my PythonAudioProcessing hobby project GitHub page.

The purpose of PythonAudioProcessing is threefold:
- Analyse raw audio music files using Fourier transformation and transform it to a recipe of individual musical notes.
- Play such a recipe back to illustrate the quality of the interpretation.
- Reproduce musical paterns by implemeting some form of AI such as for example a neural network or a Baysian process emulator.
